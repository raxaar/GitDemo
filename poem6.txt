In the classroom's symposium, where Git tales unfold,
A recitation commences, a saga to be scrolled.
With "git init," the prologue takes flight,
A dance of branches, in the coding twilight.

Branches weave narratives, like verses untold,
In Git's language, where wisdom unfolds.
Commits inscribe verses on the digital scroll,
In the recitation's cadence, where knowledge takes its toll.

Merge conflicts emerge, a plot twist to embrace,
Resolved with finesse, in the coder's grace.
"Push" for progress, a collaborative rhyme,
In the Git recitation, where skills climb.

"Pull" together, in a dance of commands,
In the coding symphony, where understanding expands.
So, let the classroom resonate, in Git's embrace,
In the recitation's rhythm, where coding finds its space.
