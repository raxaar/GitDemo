In the realm of code, where Git's chapters unfold,
A recitation commences, a story to be told.
With "git clone," the stage is set,
A ballet of branches, where lessons are met.

Branches entwine, like verses in the air,
In Git's syntax, a poetic affair.
Commits script tales on the digital scroll,
In the recitation's rhythm, where knowledge takes its toll.

Merge conflicts rise, a narrative storm,
Resolved with finesse, in the coder's reform.
"Push" for progress, a collaborative song,
In the Git recitation, where skills grow strong.

"Pull" together, in a dance of commands,
In the coding tapestry, where understanding expands.
Let the classroom resonate, in Git's embrace,
In the recitation's rhythm, where coding finds its grace.
