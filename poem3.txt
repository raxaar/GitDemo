In the classroom's canvas, where Git commands paint,
A recitation takes form, a coding constraint.
With "git clone," the journey commences,
A mural of branches, where learning dispenses.

Branches weave stories, like threads in the air,
In Git's syntax, a poetic affair.
Commits etch verses on the digital page,
In the recitation's cadence, wisdom takes stage.

Merge conflicts emerge, a plot twist unveiled,
Resolved with finesse, as challenges are hailed.
"Push" for progress, a collective ballet,
In the Git recitation, where knowledge holds sway.

"Pull" together, in a collaborative trance,
In the symphony of commands, let learning enhance.
So, let the classroom resonate, in Git's embrace,
In the recitation's rhythm, where coding finds grace.
