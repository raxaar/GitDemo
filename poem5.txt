In the classroom's spotlight, where Git scripts unfold,
A recitation begins, stories to be told.
With "git clone," the curtain rises high,
A play of branches, reaching for the sky.

Branches intertwine, a poetic ballet,
In Git's syntax, where coders find their way.
Commits etch verses on the digital stage,
In the recitation's rhythm, wisdom takes center stage.

Merge conflicts surface, a plot twist to weave,
Resolved with finesse, in the coder's reprieve.
"Push" for progress, a collective refrain,
In the Git recitation, where knowledge is gained.

"Pull" together, in a harmonious dance,
In the orchestra of commands, a coder's chance.
Let the classroom resonate, in Git's embrace,
In the recitation's rhythm, where coding finds its grace.
