In the classroom's script, where Git conducts its prose,
A recitation unfolds, where every coder knows,
With "git init," the overture begins,
A symphony of branches, where learning wins.

Branches stretch out like poetic lines,
In the symphony of Git, where mastery aligns.
Commits compose verses on the coding score,
In the recitation's rhythm, knowledge we explore.

Merge conflicts rise like a dramatic arc,
Resolved with finesse, leaving a lasting mark.
"Push" for progress, a collaborative song,
In the Git recitation, where skills grow strong.

"Pull" together, in a dance of commands,
In the coding ballet, where understanding expands.
So, let the classroom echo with Git's grace,
In the recitation's embrace, where knowledge finds its place.
